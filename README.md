# Regression-Models
Comparison of 4 regression models (Support vector, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and Random Forest) to predict the strength of concrete as part of an Applied Machine Learning course in Spring 2023. 

The 4 models fitted and compared using 5-fold cross validation, and GridSearch and RandomizedSearch were used for hyperparameter tuning.
